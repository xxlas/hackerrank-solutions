/*
    Alice has a binary string. She thinks a binary string is beautiful if and only if it doesn't contain the substring "010".

    In one step, Alice can change a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. 
    Count and print the minimum number of steps needed to make Alice see the string as beautiful.

    For example, if Alice's string is b=010 she can change any one element and have a beautiful string.
