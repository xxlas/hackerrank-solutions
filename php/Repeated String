/*
    Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.

    Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.

    For example, if the string s="abcac" and n=10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, 
    the first 10 characters of her infinite string. 
    There are 4 occurrences of a in the substring.
