/*
  Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
  but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
  She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), 
  and the actual average salary.

  Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), 
  and round it up to the next integer.
  
  Note: Salary is measured in dollars per month and its value is < 10^5.
