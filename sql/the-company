/*
  Amber's conglomerate corporation just acquired some new companies. Each of the companies follows this hierarchy: 

  Founder -> Lead Manager -> Senior Manager -> Manager -> Employee

  Given the table schemas below, write a query to print
  the company_code, founder name, total number of lead managers, total number of senior managers, 
  total number of managers, and total number of employees. 
  Order your output by ascending company_code.

  Note:

  The tables may contain duplicate records.
  The company_code is string, so the sorting should not be numeric. 
  For example, if the company_codes are C_1, C_2, and C_10, then the ascending company_codes will be C_1, C_10, and C_2.
